Introduction:
==
This is an application designed for global travelers. When traveling during global conflicts or natural disasters, the problem faced by travelers is that travelers do not understand the rules and regulations of the destination country. So this app can plan routes or book flights/hotels, request taxi, rent cars, find activities, places to visit, and can also help check visa requirements and restrictions at the destination and other information that can help improve the personal/group travel experience. In the event of conflict/disaster, some key information that travelers need to consider include: areas to avoid, local laws and culture, health restrictions and hazards, travel restrictions, climate, etc. There may be red zones (highest alert areas) and orange zones. Certain non-essential services may not be available in these areas. Such information should be specified in the destination country.

Understanding the challenge
==
This application integrates many functions of other applications, so this application needs to be concise and clear enough for users to use easily. 

Solution
==
Develop this application with a hierarchical structure and colors to guide users on how to use the software and avoid too many words at once.

Research and analysis
==
Study subject 1：booking.com

Good Point: 
It has the functions of booking air tickets, hotels, renting cars, and taking taxis. The web design is very beautiful and simple, and users can use it easily. It also introduces policies of different countries. It has the functions of booking air tickets, hotels, car rentals, and taxis. The web design is very beautiful and concise, and users can use it easily. It also introduces policies of different countries. It basically meets our travel app needs.

Improvement:
Different countries have different languages. I hope to add a translation option to make it easier for users to communicate at their destination.


Study subject 2: expedia.com

Improvement:

Too much text at once. The color is monotonous.
Whenthere is a lot of text and the color is monotonous, users may miss some information.


Task analysis
==
Main user goals
-
Based on the research on existing applications, I narrowed down the main user goals. They include:

  ·Simple navigation  
  
  ·No too much text info in a same time  

  ·Contrasting color



Main function I need to achieve. They include:
-

  ·booking tickets/hotels

  ·renting cars

  ·taxi

  ·Finding restaurants/hospitals/activities

  ·Places to visit

  ·Check visa status at user's destination

  ·Emergency Alert at user's destination 

User personas
==
We created 2 user personas that would represent potential users. This will allow us to better understand our users’ expectations, concerns and motivations.

The first persona is Brandon D. Wells. He represents users who wants to have family trip in a different country but nobody in his family can speak local language.

Second persona is Rachel McAdams. She is a traveler, Youtuber. She wants to travel around the world and record the moments during her travel.

User Journey
==

Next, I write a typical daily using routine for my persona. This process helped me decide how the app’s user experience might be designed to fit in with a navigation routine.

User Flow Diagram 
==
Now I have an idea of how the app will run. Mapping the basic flow of the app let me to figure each step on the path the users will take throughout the solution.

Sketches
==
After deciding on the features and general concepts for the application, I created sketches to outline the layout of the pages, sections, and tabs. Although these sketches were not the final version, they were instrumental in shaping the final design.

Wireframes
==
Based on the sketches, core functionality was presented as a simple grayscale prototype. This allowed the team to focus on the functionality of the application rather than its aesthetics. Early prototypes of Travel.com ensured that users could navigate the system seamlessly and intuitively.

Use contrasting colors, such as white and black, to enhance visual effects, and bright colors, such as mint, blue, orange, and pink, to draw users’ attention to the button.

Typography
==
The font is inter, this font is very neat and clean, users can see it clearly, and bold is used on the current page to tell people who are looking at this prototype.

Conclusion
==
In this project, I first understood the requirements of the project, then created personas and user journeys to understand what users would think. I also considered myself as a user of the app to think about what elements I needed to add. Sketching made my steps clearer, and creating wireframes made the final design easier.
