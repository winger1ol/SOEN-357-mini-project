Introduction:
==
This is an application designed for global travelers. When traveling during global conflicts or natural disasters, the problem faced by travelers is that travelers do not understand the rules and regulations of the destination country. So this app can plan routes or book flights/hotels, rent cars, find activities, places to visit, and can also help check visa requirements and restrictions at the destination and other information that can help improve the personal/group travel experience. In the event of conflict/disaster, some key information that travelers need to consider include: areas to avoid, local laws and culture, health restrictions and hazards, travel restrictions, climate, etc. There may be red zones (highest alert areas) and orange zones. Certain non-essential services may not be available in these areas. Such information should be specified in the destination country.

Understanding the challenge
==
This application integrates many functions of other applications, so this application needs to be concise and clear enough for users to use easily. Secondly, the policies and customs of different countries are different, and you need to study these policies carefully to avoid mistakes.

Solution
==
Policies in countries around the world change very quickly, so we need to provide a user feedback center to allow users to report policy changes in a certain place so that we can update in a timely manner.

Research and analysis

Good Point: 
It has the functions of booking air tickets, hotels, renting cars, and taking taxis. The web design is very beautiful and simple, and users can use it easily. It also introduces policies of different countries. It has the functions of booking air tickets, hotels, car rentals, and taxis. The web design is very beautiful and concise, and users can use it easily. It also introduces policies of different countries. It basically meets our travel app needs.

Improvement:
Different countries have different languages. I hope to add a translation option to make it easier for users to communicate at their destination.

Improvement:

Too much text at once.

The commercialization of the application is very important, as it involves the company's profits and future development, but too many advertisements make users feel uncomfortable. In our application, ad recommendations can be integrated into a unified section instead of appearing directly on the main page for users to see.

Main user goals
==
Based on the research on existing applications, I narrowed down the main user goals. They include:

  ·Simple navigation  
  
  ·No text info in a same time  

  ·Contrasting color



Main function I need to achieve. They include:
==

  ·Booking tickets/hotels

  ·Renting cars

  ·renting cars

  ·Finding restaurants/hospitals/activities

  ·Places to visit

  ·Check visa status at user's destination

  ·Emergency Alert at user's destination 

User personas
==
We created 2 user personas that would represent potential users. This will allow us to better understand our users’ expectations, concerns and motivations.

The first persona is Brandon D. Wells. He represents users who wants to have family trip in a different country but nobody in his family can speak local language.

Second persona is Rachel McAdams. She is a traveler, Youtuber. She wants to travel around the world and record the moments during her travel.

User Journey
==

Next, I scripted a typical daily using routine for my persona. This process helped me decide how the app’s user experience might be designed to fit in with a navigation routine.
