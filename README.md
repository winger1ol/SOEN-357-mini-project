Introduction:
==
This is an application designed for global travelers. When traveling during global conflicts or natural disasters, the problem faced by travelers is that travelers do not understand the rules and regulations of the destination country. So this app can plan routes or book flights/hotels, rent cars, find activities, places to visit, and can also help check visa requirements and restrictions at the destination and other information that can help improve the personal/group travel experience. In the event of conflict/disaster, some key information that travelers need to consider include: areas to avoid, local laws and culture, health restrictions and hazards, travel restrictions, climate, etc. There may be red zones (highest alert areas) and orange zones. Certain non-essential services may not be available in these areas. Such information should be specified in the destination country.

Understanding the challenge
==
This application integrates many functions of other applications, so this application needs to be concise and clear enough for users to use easily. Secondly, the policies and customs of different countries are different, and you need to study these policies carefully to avoid mistakes.
